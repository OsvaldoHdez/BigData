### <html><H3 align="center"> Pair coding </H3></html>
#### Definition.
Pair programming is where two developers work using a single machine. Each has a keyboard and mouse. One programmer acts as the coding controller, while the other will serve as an observer who will check the code being written, proofread, and spell-correct it, while also figuring out where to go. These roles can be changed at any time: the driver will become the observer and vice versa.

It is also commonly called "pairing", "pair programming" and "paired programming".
